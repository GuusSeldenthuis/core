Wispr is an experimental cryptocurrency which aims to bring a blockchain-backed secure messaging system, along with several other state-of-the-art blockchain features, as announced in our roadmap.<br>
Forked off of [PIVX](https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX), it's a fully Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrency with a fair reward system that encourages every type of user to stake and make the network more secure and efficient.
- Anonymized transactions & consensus using the [_Zerocoin Protocol_](http://www.wispr.org/zwsp) and [zPoS](https://wispr.org/zpos/).
- light/mobile wallet privacy using the [Zerocoin Light Node Protocol](https://wispr.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Zerocoin_Light_Node_Protocol.pdf)
- Fast transactions featuring guaranteed zero confirmation transactions, we call it _SwiftX_.

### Premine
The initial coins were premined in a private PoW phase up to block 450. Each block held 125,000 coins and some blocks were PoS in order to make a total of 25,000,000 WSP. Due to mining calculations an extra 125,000 WSP was mined and later [burned](https://explorer.wispr.tech/tx/ccabff166654a078da5cda2aa758e1f801f14e8886c8b2fcc9e2d32126755fb9).<br>
To find out how the premine was distributed, check our [ANN thread](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2561885).
